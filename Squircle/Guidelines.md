# Squircle - Guidelines

---

## Do / Don't

### React (Web)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Consistent sm (32px) across all list rows | Mixed sizes (16 / 40 / 24 px) — visual noise |
| Use `type="icon" variant="subtle"` in transaction and list rows — it's the primary pattern in Shine | Use `variant="primary"` in dense lists — the subtle background is less distracting in data-heavy contexts |
| Use Squircle to illustrate list item types (categories, transaction types) and for collaborator avatars — these are the two main contexts in Shine | Use Squircle as a decorative element unrelated to content identity |

### Native (Mobile)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Use Squircle to illustrate list item types and collaborator avatars on mobile — same as React | |
