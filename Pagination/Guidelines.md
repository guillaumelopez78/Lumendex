# Pagination - Guidelines

---

## Do / Don't

### React (Web)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| "1–20 of 834" + ellipsis — navigates any dataset | All 22 pages rendered — breaks at 50+ pages |
| Use numbered pagination (always page numbers, never infinite scroll) — the only pagination pattern in Shine | Use infinite scroll or a "Load more" button — Shine uses numbered pages exclusively |
| Hide the Pagination component when there is only 1 page — show it only when there are 2 or more pages | Always show Pagination regardless of total pages — it's meaningless with a single page |
| Let the user choose their page size — a page size selector is part of the Pagination pattern in Shine | Force a fixed page size — the user should be able to control how many items they see |

### Native (Mobile)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Use numbered pagination on mobile — hide when only 1 page | Use infinite scroll on mobile — numbered pages is the only pattern |
