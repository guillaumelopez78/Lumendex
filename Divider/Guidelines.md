# Divider - Guidelines

---

## Do / Don't

### React (Web)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Divider between distinct sections — clear grouping | Divider between every list item — use padding instead |
| Default to `size="sm"` and `visibility="low"` — these are the most used combinations in Shine | Use `high` visibility or large sizes by default — keep Dividers discreet |
| Use Dividers both between page sections and inside components (Cards, Menus, Sidebars) — both are valid contexts | Avoid Dividers inside components — they are appropriate in both page-level and component-level layouts |

### Native (Mobile)
