# Switch - Guidelines

---

## Do / Don't

### React (Web)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Descriptive labels — user knows exactly what each toggle controls | "Enable" and "Toggle" — no context for the user |
| Apply changes immediately on toggle — never require a Save button after flipping a Switch | Put a Switch inside a form with a Submit button — use Checkbox for form-based multi-select |
| Use Switch to activate/deactivate collaborator access or permissions — it's the main pattern in Shine for rights management | Show a confirmation modal before applying a Switch toggle — the action should be instantaneous |

### Native (Mobile)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Apply changes immediately on toggle, same as React | Require a Save button after toggling a Switch on mobile |
| Use Switch for permissions and access rights on mobile — same pattern as React | |
