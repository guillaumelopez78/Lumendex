# Select - Guidelines

---

## Do / Don't

### React (Web)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| Select for 5+ options — comparison not needed | 2 options in a Select — Radio shows both at once |
| Use Select even for long lists (20+ options) — it's the standard pattern in Shine regardless of list size | Switch to Autocomplete based on list length alone — only use Autocomplete when search is genuinely needed |
| Rely on the placeholder for filter Selects ("Select a status…") — no global convention for a "All" option yet | Add a "All" or "None" option by default — no cross-team convention defined yet, align per-feature |

### Native (Mobile)
