# Pin - Guidelines

---

## Do / Don't

### React (Web)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| 6 segments — focus auto-advances, paste fills all | Single input — no guidance on position or progress |
| Use Pin for OTP (SMS/email, 6 digits) and app login PIN (4 digits) — these are the two confirmed use cases in Shine | Use Pin for other numeric inputs (amounts, account numbers) — it's specifically for codes with fixed lengths |
| Set `mask={false}` for OTP codes — users should see the code they received | Mask all codes — only use `mask={true}` for sensitive PINs (app login, security codes) |

### Native (Mobile)


| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|---|---|
| OTP (6 digits, unmasked) and app login PIN (4 digits, masked) — same as React | Use Pin for other numeric inputs |
